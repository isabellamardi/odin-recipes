 <h2>About</h2>
 <p>Ciambellone or ciambella cake means donut cake in the Italian language.
    It's a classic Italian sponge cake made with extra-virgin olive oil 
    instead of butter and baked in a bundt pan to give it its traditional 
    donut shape. If you think it's unusual to use olive oil instead of butter
     in a cake, trust me, for us Italians it's not, and we do it quite
    often actually!</p>
<p>Perfect for a breakfast treat or snack, accompanied by a cup of milk or coffee,
   this ciambella cake is easy to prepare: you whisk eggs and sugar for a few
   minutes, add in the remaining ingredients, then pour into a pan and bake.</p>
