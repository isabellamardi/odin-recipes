 <h2>About</h2>
 <p>Ciambellone or ciambella cake means donut cake in the Italian language.
    It's a classic Italian sponge cake made with extra-virgin olive oil 
    instead of butter and baked in a bundt pan to give it its traditional 
    donut shape. If you think it's unusual to use olive oil instead of butter
     in a cake, trust me, for us Italians it's not, and we do it quite
    often actually!</p>
<p>Perfect for a breakfast treat or snack, accompanied by a cup of milk or coffee,
   this ciambella cake is easy to prepare: you whisk eggs and sugar for a few
   minutes, add in the remaining ingredients, then pour into a pan and bake.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
   <li>4 eggs</li>
   <li>180 g sugar</li>
   <li>120 ml extra-virgin olive oil</li>
   <li>150 ml milk</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
   <li>zest of one orange</li>
   <li>300 g all purpose flour</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Preheat oven to 340°F/170°C and generously butter and flour a 9-inch or 10-inch springform bundt pan.</li>
   <li>In a large bowl whisk the eggs and sugar with a hand mixer until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes.</li>
   <li>Continue to whisk and slowly pour in the extra-virgin olive oil, followed by the milk, then whisk in the vanilla extract and orange zest.</li>
   <li>Place a sieve over the bowl, add the flour and baking powder and sift the ingredients into the bowl. Whisk all the ingredients gently until just combined, do not over mix.</li>
   <li>Pour the cake batter into the prepared bundt pan. Place in the oven and bake for about 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
   <li>
Remove the ciambellone from the oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature, then remove from the cake pan. Sprinkle some confectioner's sugar on top if you like and serve.</li>
