 <h2>About</h2>
 <p>This Italian cream bun dates back to ancient Roman times
    and is steeped in tradition. Originally, these maritozzi 
    buns were without cream but contained ingredients like figs
    and honey and were prepared by wives to sustain their hard 
    working husbands. Gradually the recipe evolved but remained a 
    favorite that no one could resist. In the Middle Ages, these 
    were the one exception during Lent when all other sweets
    were banned.</p>

<p>Today maritozzi alla panna, which means with cream, are still popular
   in Rome and the Lazio region and the fame of these buns is spreading
   around the world. In Rome, Maritozzo Day is dedicated to the bun and
   takes place in early December each year. Now you can bake your own whenever 
   your heart desires! This isn’t a fast recipe and it will require patience 
   and time but the results are worth it!</p>

    <li>½ cup whole milk warmed but not hot</li>
</ul>

<h4>Whipped Cream Filling</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups (480mls) heavy whipping creamr</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<h4>Sponge</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Mix together flour and yeast then stir in warm milk.
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to stand
        at room temperature for 60 minutes. It will rise and then 
        fall back on itself. It should have a pleasant yeasty smell.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Dough</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In the large bowl of a stand mixer combine the sponge, eggs,
         granulated sugar, olive oil, honey, orange zest, lemon zest 
         and vanilla paste. Beat with a flat beater on low speed until 
         well combined.</li>
    <li>Add all but ½ cup of the flour and beat on low. Increase the speed
        to medium and beat for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Scrape the sides and the bottom of the bowl with a spatula to 
        ensure all of the dough is combined. Then switch to a dough hook. 
        Add the remaining flour and the salt then knead on low speed for 
        5 more minutes until the dough is soft and supple.</li>
    <li>Oil your work surface with a little olive oil. Scrape the dough 
        onto the oiled surface. Oil your hands as well. Flatten the dough 
        into an oblong shape then fold in half. Turn the dough 90º then 
        repeat the flattening and folding. Fold 6 times including the first 
        folding. Form into a ball.</li>
    <li>Clean out the stand mixer bowl or use another bowl and rub it with 
        a little oil. Place the dough into the bowl and turn it over to coat 
        with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to 
        rise for 2 hours until almost tripled.</li>
    <li>Divide the maritozzi dough into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion 
        into a slightly elongated, oval shape and place it onto lined baking 
        sheets.</li>
    <li>Spray the tops of the dough lightly with cooking spray and cover 
        loosely with plastic wrap. Allow to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF/180ºC.</li>
    <li>Brush the maritozzi buns with egg wash and bake for 12-14 minutes 
        or until the loaves are dark, golden brown and cooked through.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven. Brush with syrup and return to the oven for 1 or 2 minutes to set the syrup.</li>
    <li>Cool on a wire rack.</li>
    <li>Use a serrated knife to make a cut in the bun either vertical or not 
        quite horizontal. Don't cut all the way through. It should be like a 
        hot dog bun.</li>
    <li>Open the maritozzi buns as wide as you can without splitting them and 
        pipe or spoon the whipped cream in generously.</li>
    <li>Smooth off with a dinner knife or spatula. Dust with powdered 
        sugar if desired.</li>
    <li>Serve maritozzi immediately or refrigerate for up to 6 hours. 
        If refrigerated, remove 10 minutes before serving to allow 
        the bun to soften.</li>
    <li>Leftover maritozzi should be placed in an airtight container 
        and stored in the fridge for a day or two in the fridge. 
        However, the buns will not be as soft.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Sugar Syrup</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat sugar and water and stir until sugar is dissolved. 
        Then boil for 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Whipped Cream Filling</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Pour the cream into the bowl of an electric stand mixer or a 
        large bowl if you're using a electric hand mixer. Using a 
        whisk attachment begin to whisk slowly increasing the speed 
        gradually. Whisk until stiff peaks form. Take care not to 
        overwhip or you'll end up with butter. Refrigerate until 
        ready to use.</li>
